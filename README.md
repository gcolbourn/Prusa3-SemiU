All models are in the box_frame folder, including models for aluminium single plate.

Original files from https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3, https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3-vanilla, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18379. Changes:

- minimal Prusa i3 x ends: zip ties, built-in adjustable tensioner and easy z height adjustor.
- increased height on y corners to avoid clearance issue with bed mountings.
- combined mounting holes for hot end -> extruder & extruder -> x-carriage (uses M5x40 bolts).
- strengthened and lengthened extruder idler arms.
- widened a 608ZZ bearing hole on the extruder a bit so it fits better (original extruder by jonaskuehling:
